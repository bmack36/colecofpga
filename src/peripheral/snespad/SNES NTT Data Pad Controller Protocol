About
This document is part of the no$sns emulator/debugger help text. Copyright 2012
by Martin Korth (nocash).
PPU and APU specs are widely based on Anomie's great specs (on that part I've
mainly rearranged and reformatted the Anomie's txt files, verified most of it
on real hardware, and discovered only a few additional details).
For information on Add-Ons like Controllers or Cartridges with Coprocessors:
There haven't been any all-in-one specs (not even a complete list of existing
add-ons), so I needed to collect scattered fragments of information from
hundreds of webpages (and do a lot of puzzling and reverse-engineering on my
own).
The result should be a fairly complete document that covers almost everything
about the SNES hardware. There are still thousands of missing details (marked
by words like unknown, whatever, might, maybe, probably, or by question marks).
Info on such details (or donated hardware for research purposes) would be very
welcome!
